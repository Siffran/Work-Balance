# Work-Balance
Work-Balance is an email application prototype that through its authentication process suggests the most appropriate email account for the current situation. This is done with the help of the location of the device and the time of day. By using a fingerprint scanner as the primary way to log in the process has never been simpler or smoother. Work-Balance helps you focus when you need to focus and relax when you need to relax by automatically separating your work-life from your private-life.

The Work-Balance app was developed by Edvin Bengtsson and David Benjaminsson as part of the course Mobile Computing (CUI196) given by Mehmet Aydın Baytaş at the Chalmers University of Technology.
